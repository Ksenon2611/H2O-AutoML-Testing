# H2O-AutoML-Testing
AutoML is a function in H2O that automates the process of building a large number of models, with the goal of finding the "best" model.

In this case we build AutoML on Sex classification dataset and see how it works.
Also we will test 2 modern libraries for exploratory data analysis:
* PANDAS-PROFILING: This library allows to build comprehensive exploratory data report about considered data sample, including visualization of attribute distribution, missings and correlation matrix.
And do it all by 1 row of code!
* CUFFLINKS & PLOTLY: these 2 library make your data visulization more interactive and alive :)
